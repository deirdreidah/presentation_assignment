#1.Create a class called Car with attributes brand and color. Instantiate an object of the Car class and print its attributes.
#2.Add a method called start_engine to the Car class that prints a message saying the engine of the car has started. Create an instance of Car and call the method.

#3.Create a class called BankAccount with attributes account_number and balance. Add methods to:

#Deposit an amount.
